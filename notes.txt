UI image view - this may be contained within a UI view 
React - Javascript - brigde Native
with react native we use JS in our components and when the app runs react native will then create the correct UI for the different IOS
in order to create our UI react native has some core components which we can use: View, Text, Image, ScrollView TextInput
we can wrap our layout inside of a view and inside of it we may want to display some text using Text core compoennt or a button 
using button component.
we can think of a view like a div
import React from "react"
import {View, Text} from 'react-native'
your component is a constant function so it starts with const and any JSX must be returned and export default function components
core components are the ones that we import  such as View and Text but we also refer to everything in the file as a component
we use the term element to describe what we see on the screen but this is contained within what we call a component
break down what we are building, the UI is separated into different pieces
for styling
js object instead of standard css
font-size->fontSize
<View style ={{}}></View>
there are a few different ways to apply styles but we are going to start by using inline styles
 <View style={{background:"pink"}}>
when using inline styles the styles are applied as we create the component
inline can get messy so we use stylesheets instead
import stylesheets from the reactnative api
if you are using flex=1 all the components up the tree must use flex =1 too which is why we also apply it to the outer safe area view
density independant pixels
react native is unitless
react-native-vector-icons for icons
flex direction by default is column?
a component is a function that returns some JSX, JSX is the syntax that we use, we show or render something to the user
under the hood JSX gets turned into JS by using babble
we export the user to be able to use it in our application
.js not needed if relative path
react promotes comoponent reuse because it is a component-based framework: one root component, multiple other compoenents, root: App.js, others SRC folder
helps with debugging and easier testing and DRY - don't repeat yourself
Lists 
3 core components that we have available
    flatlist
    sectionlist
    virtualized Lists (diluted version of the 2 above)
flatlist: if you have a list that you want to display the user (standard list), renderItem and data are req props
sectionlist: when you need a list brocken into sections, each section has it's own items, renderItem and sections are required props, you must pass in an array of objects bc the list is broken up in sections

looking at flat lists: const DATA =["Ford", "Toyota", "Fiat"] need to pass an array iwth the data we want to be display inside the screen, when using API data most likely also using an array containing obejcts too
renderItem - list's own render function and this will get called on every array element, it's job it to then decide how this element gets displayed to the user.
renderItem prop gets past a function and this will get call on every array element
renderItem={({tem})=> <Item title={item.title} amount = {item.amount}/>} // do this if the item is very simple
renderItem ={renderItem} //passing a reference to a function as we may want to render out quite a few things for our list element, we pass a single argument to the function which is an object and this is the item we are rendering
in summary
flatlist
standard list, required props (data and renderItem), data must be an array, renderItem displays the list element to the user
sectionlist
when we need a list broken into sections, required propr (sections and renderItem), data must be an array of objects, renderIten displays the list element to the user
when working with lists you need to provide a unique key to each element in the data the reason behind this is largely
performanced based and it means that under the hood react native is able to keep track of each item in the list. this allows it to be updated not rebuilt everytime the ui rerenders and an item in the list has changed
the key must be a string, each element must have its own unique id   
the key can be added to the data or we can use the key extractor prop.
in our data we can add keys to each item.
if warning: missing key for items, make sure to specify a key property on each item or provide a custom keyExtractor
itemSeparator another interesting prp to use, also listheader and lsitfooter
flatlist only get rerender if the data changes and only renders the items currently displaying on the screen not everything at once
have performance at the back of your mind

images - 
use url better than require('path ex')
Network images must have a height set 
when sizing images you can use a height and width or 
you can use aspect ratio with the height and/or the width
Be mindful of storage sizes when you are using static images
be aware of the supported types png jpeg bmp gif psd
colors reactnative: https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors

props - (property)
they are used to pass data from parent to child
when you create an object in js you add properties to the object and give the properties a value
properties that are given a value of some sort but they are used as way to pass our data down from the parent to a child
we can use props to customise our components
promotes component reusability
core components in react native come with props whic can be used
for e.g Text core component has disabled and ellipsizedMode
FlatList renderItem and data

folder structure
have a folder for the screens and another one for the components
screens are the screens the user will typically see e.g upcomingWeather is a screen, the components are buttons alerts or footers reusable things

props let us pass in data from a parent ot a child in order to promote component reuse in react native
props in core react native components and custom components
imp: props are immutable this means they cannot be changed once the component is created - we pass the prop form the parent to the child, unidirectioinal 
data flow, data is only able to move in one direction from the parent to the child - this makes our life much easier imagine cars driving in both 
directions we'd have a collision quite easily, same would happen to our data, unidirectioinal data flow keeps things straightforward

refactoring so that our code is easier to work with moving fwd - update imports

core screens of the app are stored in the screens folder inside src

when we start to see duplication in code - in react native we are able to 
pass in multiple styles to the style prop by using array notation so if you are working on the web you might be using multiple class names but
in react native we pass the array of the  styles to the style prop and these will get merged into one object
if you have any duplciation in styles it is the last definition that it is used
this is very useful if you have a theme that you want to use in multiple places
but then we also have some additional unique styles to apply to
e.g 
 <Text style={[styles.countryName, styles.cityText]}>UK</Text>    
 const styles = StyleSheet.create({
    cityName:{
        fontSize: 40,
    },
    countryName:{
        fontSize: 30,
    },
    cityText:{
        justifyContent: "center",
        alignSelf: 'center',
        fontWeight: 'bold',
        color: 'white'
    }
})

view is like container for flexbox div
passing styles as a prop
    const {iconName, iconColor, bodyText, bodyTextStyles} = props
    return
        <View>
            <Feather name={iconName} size={50} color={iconColor} />
            <Text style={[styles.textTheme, bodyTextStyles]}>{bodyText}</Text>
        </View>

Navigation
anchor tags to link between different pages
user clicks on a link or button to navigate to new page, that url is pushed on to a stack which is datastructure
in this case it is called the browser history stack
url gets popped of the stack if the user clicks to go back to the prior page
we cannot use navigation in mobile app the same way we use it on web pages we need some way to navigate through screens
ther's no built in navigation in react native so we use a library to add navigation to the app: the 2 most pop: react navigation and react native navigation, the set up is different but their goal is the same
but react navigation is built into expo, if you want to use the other one you have to eject the app ffrom expo or create it withiut using expo
we use a NAVIGATOR - consider how the navigation between the screens occurs sliding in from right to left or drodown from top to bottom
how - using tabs is an option
we are going to use react navigation and implement tab for the user to navigate between screens:
npm install @react-navigation/native
then bc using expo:
npx expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
then set up navigation container - this will wrap the entire application, usually only do this once in the app in the root of the project (app.js)
import { NavigationContainer } from '@react-navigation/native';
push and pop items off the stack
2 ways:
if we don't want the user to navigae to screen using a tab then we'll use the stack NAVIGATOR
https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation for other examples in examples

we want https://reactnavigation.org/docs/tab-based-navigation tabs can be shown on top or bottom of screen

typically on Ios you have them at the bottom of screen vs at the top for Android
if you want to display on top for androide and bottom for ios you would need to set up a material top tabs and then decide which to display based on the platform
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/material-top-tab-navigator
https://reactnative.dev/docs/platform and then you can use the OS property:  static OS: 'android' | 'ios';

for this project:
npm install @react-navigation/bottom-tabs

set active and inactive tint colors on the navigator
https://reactnavigation.org/docs/bottom-tab-navigator

how to make our app more dynamic
static - all our screens are connected but we only display data that we've hardcoded, for this we've only used props to pass data around from parent to child component

dynamic - update and response to user input
for this we use STATE

State is an object that contains information about a component that we want to track
in the object we use key value pairs to track data that we are going to track that over time is going to change
be inside the room and keep track of something that is going to change in the room e.g messy state of a room true false or dark true or false, wet true or false
the benefits of using state in an app is that things can be changed, added, removed, modified.
we can update our data an retrigger ui  updated based on these changes. when the data of our component changes the componenet will re-render
initial render- when the component first renders on the screen to the user
if we use state and state changes the component rerenders
irl this change in state might be more likely to occur based on a user event such as a button press or user inputs something in input field

State is an object that contains information about a component that we want to track
in the object we use key-value pairs
helps us to add, remove and modif things in our component
we can trigger UI updates based ont he changes
when state changes the component rerenders

props let us pass data between components
help us to internally manage data within our components - can't modify state of a component outside of a component
Redux is a library that helps us manage state

  plugins: ["@typescript-eslint", "react", "prettier"],
    extends: [
    "eslint:recommended",
    // "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",


//react does not render the component when the value of the variable changes
if this happensa rerenders would be happening all over the place and would result in a v bad user experience
hooks are functions we can use inside our function components
useState setting up some piece of state for our componentto use useState we pass in an an initial or default starting value dor the piece of state
const [isFlooded, setIsFloodeded] = useState(false)
square brackets are using array destructuring
first value is piece of state and the second is a function to update the state

hooks
stateless is use for components without state 
created with a fucniton
hooks are like special functions containing reusable logic
every hook starts with the work use
rules:
you can only use hooks from inside of React functions
hooks must be called at the top level of a component and before the return keyword is used

useEffect hook
lets you perform sideeffects in function components
what is a side useEffect?
when we use something not inside of react within our component
stat fetching and using timers and updating the dom directly are examples of sideeffects
component did mount happens when the component is mounted
and component did update is called after updating occurs
useEffect lets us replicate these lifecycle methods
useEffect takes in a function as an argument, array as an optional second argument
the cleanup function allows to turn off or clean up our side effects os if using the counter function you would need to use the clear intercal function to stop the counter
that way we avoid memory leaks
return ()=>{console.log("Clean up")}

useEffect let us perform side effects within our function components
we can pass in a dependency array which lets you specify what data when changed you would like to trigger a re-render
we can additionally use a cleanup function to stop any of our side efffects before the component unmounts

expo location https://reactnative.directory/?search=geolocation
npx expo install expo-location
first ask permission to access their location 
then we need to get their location once we have their location we need to store it
we also need to handle their location with errors

to store api key
npm install -D react-native-dotenv
create .env file
